        <h1 style="color:blue;">Introduction</h1>
        <p> Stop motion. Very time consuming, 
            needs a lot of dedication, and most of the reward 
            at the end is simply pride in what you have done. 
            If you are looking for anything else such as monetary 
            gain or praise, a fast food job will give you a similar 
            experience with double the reward. </p>
        <h2>Equipment</h2>
        <p>You need a nice camera, and a good enough video editing software. 
            I just use my phone camera and the software I use is an iMovie 
            equivalent for windows called Movavi. It is not free and it is 
            not worth it, but it is relatively cheap compared to most video 
            editing programs. When taking pictures, be sure to not touch the 
            camera, as it makes the footage look less stable and shaky. </p>
